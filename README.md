# Welcome to the BBCode cheatsheet!
This is currently maintained by [FunctionalMetatable](//github.com/FunctionalMetatable) ([9gr](//scratch.mit.edu/users/9gr) on Scratch). Hope you enjoy!
Contributions are welcome!

## 1. The basics
This is the section for Bold, Italics, and Strikethrough.

### 1a. Bold
You can use [b][/b] tags to make text 'Bold'.

Example:
```
[b]Hello[/b] World!
```
would become **Hello** World!

### 1b. Italics
You can use [i][/i] tags to make text 'Italic'.

Example:
```
[i]This is italic text.[/i]
```
would become _This is italic text._

### 1c. Strikethrough

You can use [s][/s] tags to make text 'Strikethrough'.

Example:
```
[s]This text is crossed out[/s]
```
would become ~~This text is crossed out~~.

## 2. Things from other sites

### 2a. Images
To use images in the Scratch Forums, you need to upload your image to an approved image host, a list of them are below.

> [photobucket.com](//photobucket.com) (costs money; has a free plan of up to 250 images with a watermark)

> [cubeupload.com](//cubeupload.com) (used by most Scratchers, however users must sign up for a account to upload images)

> [imageshack.com](//imageshack.com) and [imageshack.us](//imageshack.us) (30-day free trial with account before payment is required)[1][2][3]

> [scratchr.org](//scratchr.org) (The ScratchR domain is no longer owned by the Scratch Team, and is now an SMS sending service.)

> [wikipedia.org](//wikipedia.org) and related subdomains

> [wikimedia.org](//wikimedia.org) and related subdomains

> [scratch-dach.info](//scratch-dach.info) (Now redirects to de.scratch-wiki.info)

> [scratch.mit.edu](//scratch.mit.edu) (most commonly using project thumbnails)

> [wiki.scratch.mit.edu](//wiki.scratch.mit.edu) (This domain can no longer be updated because of the Domain Transfer)

> [scratch-wiki.info](//scratch-wiki.info) (This works with all language subdomains, e.g. en.scratch-wiki.info)

> [_source_](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Image_Hosting) from the scratch wiki
